# Wordle_game
Project contains two codes: first one is used for create base of words.
I decided to not using python library "randomwords", because it contains a lot of imaginary words.
Also, this game requires checking if user write existing word, and this library and this library doesn't offer that possibility.
Main program using generated data with 5-letters words. To create app I used library PyGame.
